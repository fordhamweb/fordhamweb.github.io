      <div id="pr1" class="anchor"></div>
      <h3>Project 1: One-Page Website - Due Oct 3</h3>
      <p>Make a one-page website about your favorite book. Use this opportunity to use your beginner knowledge of HTML and CSS. You can include text, images, animated gifs, reviews, characters, your personal thoughts, original images you create, etc. What is the purpose of your website (to sell the book, provide spoilers, summarize the plot, visualize the book using my own art, review the book)? Be flexible with the presentation and design - you will likely NOT be able to do what you envision but work within those limitations. As in all projects, experiment! </p>
      <p>Requirements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>One page only (index.html), a stylesheet and a folder for images and other assets.</li>
        <li>Use as many HTML tags and CSS properties as you'd like.</li>
        <li>Websites do not have to be responsive, you can adjust the browser to the size you need for the presentation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Recommended Process:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Think about what kind of content you'd like to include and start gathering it. If using text from another website, please source and provide a link. </li>
        <li>Create a local folder "project1". Folder should contain index.html, a stylesheet and a sub-folder for images and other assets.</li>
        <li>When the project is complete, upload this entire folder to your GitHub class website. The link should look something like: <i>github-username.github.io/class-site/project1/</i>. You can continue to edit your project and re-upload.</li>
        <li>Add your URL to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jIyYjKi0HmZT9r9SZ3Yr2WoFCXArSkFv3XQtAZ4hZbs/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">spreadsheet</a>.</li>
      </ol>

      <div id="pr2" class="anchor"></div>

      <h3>Project 2: Website Critique - Due Oct 17</h3>
      
      <p>Choose a website or app you use frequently or have used recently. Exclude social media such as IG, Facebook, TikTok, X, WhatsApp, etc. and default apps on your devices such as Photos, Mail, Camera, Weather, etc. </p>
      <p>Critique the chosen website or app in terms of content, visual appeal/UI, and interactivity/UX - use this <a href="files/6-WebSlides.pdf" target="_blank">slideshow for  guidelines</a>. More guidelines are below but you do not need to answer every question Your critique should be presented as a website, +/-1000 words, and include screenshots or other graphics/<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_video.asp" target="_blank">video</a> to illustrate your critique. Keep the design simple - this project is about how well you communicate and express ideas, how observant you are, how you can translate a website experience. There’s no better way to articulate design than with writing.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Introduction: What type of website is this (corporate, e-commerce, journalism, artist, blog, etc.) and what is its purpose? Examples: Does it aim to inform people about the company or organization, to advertise a product, to provide a means for online purchase, to recruit new clients/volunteers, to convince people of a particular cause? Who is the target audience?</li>
        <li>Content: Does the content contribute to the site’s purpose? Can you easily read the text? Are the images/media engaging?</li>
        <li>Visual Appeal/UI: Is there a visual hierarchy and how does the design accomplish it? Is there consistency with colors, fonts, layouts? Are there other engaging visual elements? Are the typefaces appropriate? Does it work well on other devices?</li>
        <li>Interactivity/UX: Does the homepage direct you where to go or what to do? Does the site provide easy navigation to help you find content? What are other ways you interact with this website or app? Is it an enjoyable experience overall?</li>
        <li>Evaluation / Recommendations: What could be improved and how?</li>
      </ul>
       <p>Recommended Process:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Create a local folder "project2". Folder should contain index.html, a stylesheet and a sub-folder for images and other assets.</li>
        <li>When the project is complete, upload this entire folder to your GitHub class website. The link should look something like: <i>github-username.github.io/class-site/project2/</i>. You can continue to edit your project and re-upload.</li>
        <li>Add your URL to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jIyYjKi0HmZT9r9SZ3Yr2WoFCXArSkFv3XQtAZ4hZbs/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">spreadsheet</a>.</li>
        <li>1-2 volunteers will present in class.</li>
      </ol>

      <!--<h3>Project 3</h3>--> 


      <h3>Project 3: Narrative - Due Nov 21</h3>
      <p>Create a website that tells a story. You could use an existing short story, fairy tale, poem. Or, you can design a personal narrative: 24 hours in my day, my favorite artists, how to make my mom's chocolate cake, why I love <i>Friends</i> tv show, etc. </p>
      <p>Requirements:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Multiple pages or a single page.</li>
      <li>Use text, images, or videos. </li>
      <li>Think about the various ways users can access parts of the story - do they need to follow a set path (linear) or can they view the story in a random order (non-linear)? How will you lead them there? Also consider how your design will help the user figure out what to click on.</li>
      <li>Your website could be informative, artistic, or experimental. What’s important is that it demonstrates how the web can be used to communicate in a linear or non-linear way.</li>
      <li>Bonus if your website is responsive!</li>
    </ul>
      <p>Recommended Process:</p>
      <ol>

      <h3>Project 4 - DUE THURS, DEC 19 by 11:30am</h3>
      <p>With the knowledge you've gained all semester, re-do <a href="https://fordhamweb.github.io/exercises.html#ex1">Exercise 1</a> and design a personal digital portfolio website which includes a proper introduction and links to exercises and projects completed in this class. Some considerations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Is this website multiple pages (a homepage introduction; each project on its own page with proper screenshots and descriptive text of your design process)? <a href="https://www.josieyoung.co/" target="_blank">Example</a> | <a href="https://www.aronmayo.com/" target="_blank">Example</a>.</li>
        <li>Is the website one page with introduction at the top and then a grid of thumbnail images that link to each final project url? <a href="https://mindynguyen.me/" target="_blank">Example</a>.</li>
        <li>Do you have a short and sweet introduction? Have you designed your website with personality? <a href="https://letasobierajski.com/" target="_blank">Example</a>.</li>
        <li>Are you showing interesting project images so the user is likely to click on them? <a href="https://gvo.works/" target="_blank">Example</a>.</li>
        <li>Are there other engaging elements like animations, hover effects?</li>
        <li>This project can be as complicated or simple as you'd like. Grade is based on your creativity, how you've incorporated your personality into your design, and how you use code to create an inviting user experience. If you have other ideas of what you'd like this personal website to be, lmk.</li>
        <li>Optional: use media queries to make the website responsive.</li>
        <li>Optional: Use Javascript or JQuery to make the website more interactive.</li>
        <li>Upload and replace the index file from your main URL <i>github-username.github.io</i> or use a new folder. Also upload additional files and sub-folders. Add the URL to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jIyYjKi0HmZT9r9SZ3Yr2WoFCXArSkFv3XQtAZ4hZbs/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">spreadsheet</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Project 4 will not be presented. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>

      <!--
<p>The final project is completely up to you! This gives you space to explore your personal goals and interests. Consider all the websites you’ve looked at and created. Which ones offer the kind of space you’re interested in making (think back to this <a href="pdfs/schwulst-mywebsiteisashiftinghouse.pdf" target="_blank">reading</a>)? What kind of space would you like to add to the web? What could you challenge yourself to make? Some ideas include:</p>
      <ul>
<li>Feel like telling another digital story? Choose different content, styles and methods from your last story.</li>
<li>Interested in creating something more corporate or practical (what does this even mean)? Hypothetically work with a company to digitally market a product or service. Or, make up your own company, product or service website.</li>
<li>Have a topic you want to communicate? Create a resource from your point of view (like our Moon website).</li>
<li>Want to be experimental? Use creative coding to visually explore animations, digital art, etc.</li>
      <li>Note: Personal portfolios are not an option.</li>
    </ul>
      <p>Requirements:</p>
      <ul>
<li>Make it personal and unique. In terms of content, that could mean your own images, illustrations, photos and writing. In terms of coding, can you go beyond what you might expect to see from a Squarespace or Wix template? The final website should be multi-paged, or multi-layered with interactivity considered.</li>
      <li>Use html/css; js is optional.</li>
      <li>Bonus if your website is responsive!</li>
    </ul>
      <p>Process:</p>
      <ol>
<li>What is the website and it's goals? Who is the intended audience/users? Remember an audience could be large or small. Describe some initial design ideas.</li>
      <li>Brainstorm, create a <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNWsZmzg=/" target="_blank">sitemap</a>, gather assets, write, sketch.</li>
      <li>Design with html/css/js in a local folder "project4". Folder should contain html pages, a stylesheet, javascript and a sub-folder for images and other assets.</li>
        <li>When the project is complete, upload this entire folder to your GitHub class website. The link should look something like: <i>your-github-username.github.io/class-site/project4/</i>. You can continue to edit your project and re-upload.</li>
        <li>Add your URL to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jIyYjKi0HmZT9r9SZ3Yr2WoFCXArSkFv3XQtAZ4hZbs/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">spreadsheet</a>.
      <li>Update your <a href="https://pb-fordham.github.io/web-sp24/exercises.html#ex5">class homepage</a> to include a link to this final project.</li>
      <li>On Mon, May 6 at 1:30pm, be prepared to present your website. Attendance, presentation, participation, and final website are required. No extensions unless you plan on filing for an INC!</li>
