      <h3>Project 1: One-Page Website due Feb 17</h3>
      <p>Make a one-page website about your favorite person, place or thing. Use this opportunity to use your beginner knowledge of HTML and CSS. You can include text, images, animated gifs, reviews, characters, your personal thoughts, original images you create, etc. What is the purpose of your website (to communicate, to convince, to sell, to experiment, to write)? Be flexible with the presentation and design - you will likely NOT be able to do what you envision but work within those limitations. As in all projects, experiment! </p>
      <p>Requirements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>One page only (index.html), a stylesheet and a folder for images and other assets.</li>
        <li>Use as many HTML tags and CSS properties as you'd like.</li>
        <li>Websites do not have to be responsive, you can adjust the browser to the size you need for the presentation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Recommended Process:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Think about what kind of content you'd like to include and start gathering it. For example if doing a person, a full biography will be very long so perhaps focus on one aspect. If using text from another website, please source and provide a link. </li>
        <li>Create a local folder "project1". Folder should contain index.html, a stylesheet and a sub-folder for images and other assets.</li>
        <li>Upload this entire folder to your GitHub repository. The link should look something like: <i>username.github.io/class-site/project1/</i>. You can continue to edit your project and re-upload.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Examples: <a href="https://biesterfeldgrace.github.io/class-site/project1/" target="_blank">Chai</a>, <a href="https://tdo17.github.io/VART2004/project_1/" target="_blank">Cat</a>, <a href="https://kayakimball.github.io/class-site/project1/" target="_blank">Jellycats</a>, <a href="https://cmagtibay.github.io/webdesign/project1/" target="_blank">Van Gogh</a></p>
              <p>Add your URL to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oC0ZSJQ6mBaekrM_ds9U9-OCgyaDhHAp-Nv8KPY3E3Q/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">spreadsheet</a>. Project 1 will be presented in class. If your project is late, it will affect your grade.</p>


      <div id="pr2" class="anchor"></div>

      <h3>Project 2: Narrative due Apr 13</h3>
            <p>Create a website that tells a story. You could use an existing short story, fairy tale, poem. Or, you can design a personal narrative: 24 hours in my day, my favorite artists, how to make my mom's chocolate cake, why I love the<i>Friends</i> tv show, etc. Consider the UI and UX aspects of the website.</p>
      <p>Requirements:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Multiple pages or a single page.</li>
      <li>Use text, images, or videos. </li>
      <li>Think about the various ways users can access parts of the story - do they need to follow a set path (linear) or can they view the story in a random order (non-linear)? How will you lead them there? Also consider how your design will help the user figure out what to click on.</li>
      <li>Your website could be informative, artistic, or experimental. What’s important is that it demonstrates how the web can be used to communicate in a linear or non-linear way.</li>
      <li>Bonus if your website is responsive!</li>
    </ul>
      <p>Recommended Process:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Choose an existing story or write/compose the story. It could be written from beginning to end or you could write it as a series of ideas with no beginning or end.</li>
      <li>Create a site map to figure out how the pages are connected.</li>
      <li>Sketch out page layout ideas. Gather or create assets such as images or videos.</li>
      <!--<li><a href="files/10-WebSlides.pdf" target="_blank">Refer to the slideshow</a> for inspo.</li>-->
      <li>Design with html/css in a local folder "project2". Folder should contain html pages, a stylesheet and a sub-folder for images and other assets.</li>
        <li>Upload this entire folder to your GitHub repository. The link should look something like: <i>username.github.io/class-site/project2/</i>. You can continue to edit your project and re-upload.</li>
    </ol>
          <p>Examples: <a href="https://ft-tanvishah.github.io/Project2/INDEX.HTML" target="_blank">About Tanvi</a>, <a href="https://biesterfeldgrace.github.io/class-site/project2/" target="_blank">The Decay Feeders</a>, <a href="https://fordhamweb.github.io/graced-project2/" target="_blank">Tam Cam</a>, <a href="https://kdowd9.github.io/project2/index.html" target="_blank">The Journey</a>, <a href="https://reedgulden.github.io/Project-2/Project-2/" target="_blank">Coraline</a>, <a href="https://kayakimball.github.io/class-site//project2/" target="_blank">Studio Ghibli</a>, <a href="https://miamagdaraog.github.io/webdesign/project2/" target="_blank">The Fox & Crane</a></p>

      <h3>Project 3: Digital Portfolio due TBD</h3>
      <p>Design and develop a personal, digital portfolio website. Some suggestions and considerations:</p>
      
      <ul>

        <li>A portfolio to showcase a particular passion or skill (photography, illustration, writing, music, cooking, etc.)</li>
        <li>A class portfolio featuring work completed in this class.</li>
        <li>Is this website multiple pages (a homepage introduction; each project on its own page with multiple images and descriptive text of your design process)?</li>
        <li>Is the website one page with introduction at the top and then a grid of work below?</li>
        <li>Are you showing interesting project images so the user is likely to click on them?</li>
        <li>Have you edited your work and written engaging descriptions?</li>
        <li>Are there interactive elements like animations, hover effects, animated gifs?</li>
        <li>More recommendations can be found in the Digital Portfolios Slideshow.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Portfolio can be custom-coded using html/css/javascript and uploaded to Github <i>OR</i> you may use a <a href="https://fordhamweb.github.io/resources.html#platforms" target="_blank">website-building platform</a> of your choice. Domain name not required.</p>

</p>
