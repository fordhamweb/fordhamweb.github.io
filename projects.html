      <div id="pr1" class="anchor"></div>
      <h3>Project 1: One-Page Website - Due Feb 24</h3>
      <p>Make a one-page website about your favorite book. Use this opportunity to use your beginner knowledge of HTML and CSS. You can include text, images, animated gifs, reviews, characters, your personal thoughts, original images you create, etc. What is the purpose of your website (to sell the book, provide spoilers, summarize the plot, visualize the book using my own art, review the book)? Be flexible with the presentation and design - you will likely NOT be able to do what you envision but work within those limitations. As in all projects, experiment! </p>
      <p>Requirements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>One page only (index.html), a stylesheet and a folder for images and other assets.</li>
        <li>Use as many HTML tags and CSS properties as you'd like.</li>
        <li>Websites do not have to be responsive, you can adjust the browser to the size you need for the presentation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Recommended Process:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Think about what kind of content you'd like to include and start gathering it. If using text from another website, please source and provide a link. </li>
        <li>Create a local folder "project1". Folder should contain index.html, a stylesheet and a sub-folder for images and other assets.</li>
        <li>When the project is complete, upload this entire folder to your GitHub class website. The link should look something like: <i>github-username.github.io/class-site/project1/</i>. You can continue to edit your project and re-upload.</li>
        <li>Add your URL to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16c9pSDthgbfFv7zPUyde-edU-30LOT2TNnuy8vnBUOw/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">spreadsheet</a>.</li>
      </ol>

      <div id="pr2" class="anchor"></div>

      <h3>Project 2: Narrative - Due Apr 7</h3>
            <p>Create a website that tells a story. You could use an existing short story, fairy tale, poem. Or, you can design a personal narrative: 24 hours in my day, my favorite artists, how to make my mom's chocolate cake, why I love <i>Friends</i> tv show, etc. Consider the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sXiN1kyNQM5wjKd98UnjEaCK_nL_4Rjo1KUBZkxKppc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">UI and UX</a> aspects of the website.</p>
      <p>Requirements:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Multiple pages or a single page.</li>
      <li>Use text, images, or videos. </li>
      <li>Think about the various ways users can access parts of the story - do they need to follow a set path (linear) or can they view the story in a random order (non-linear)? How will you lead them there? Also consider how your design will help the user figure out what to click on.</li>
      <li>Your website could be informative, artistic, or experimental. What’s important is that it demonstrates how the web can be used to communicate in a linear or non-linear way.</li>
      <li>Bonus if your website is responsive!</li>
    </ul>
      <p>Recommended Process:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Choose an existing story or write/compose the story. It could be written from beginning to end or you could write it as a series of ideas with no beginning or end.</li>
      <li>Create a site map to figure out how the pages are connected.</li>
      <li>Sketch out page layout ideas. Gather or create assets such as images or videos.</li>
      <!--<li><a href="files/10-WebSlides.pdf" target="_blank">Refer to the slideshow</a> for inspo.</li>-->
      <li>Design with html/css in a local folder "project2". Folder should contain html pages, a stylesheet and a sub-folder for images and other assets.</li>
        <li>When the project is complete, upload this entire folder to your GitHub class website. The link should look something like: <i>username.github.io/class-site/project2/</i>. You can continue to edit your project and re-upload.</li>
        <li>Add your URL to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16c9pSDthgbfFv7zPUyde-edU-30LOT2TNnuy8vnBUOw/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">spreadsheet</a>.</li>
      <li>Project 2 will be presented in class. If your project is late, you will not be able to present it which will affect your grade.</li>
    </ol>

      <h3>Project 3 - DUE DATE TBD</h3>
      <p>With the knowledge you've gained all semester, design a personal digital portfolio website. Details soon.</p>
      <!--
      <ul>
        <li>Is this website multiple pages (a homepage introduction; each project on its own page with proper screenshots and descriptive text of your design process)? <a href="https://www.josieyoung.co/" target="_blank">Example</a> | <a href="https://www.aronmayo.com/" target="_blank">Example</a>.</li>
        <li>Is the website one page with introduction at the top and then a grid of thumbnail images that link to each final project url? <a href="https://mindynguyen.me/" target="_blank">Example</a>.</li>
        <li>Do you have a short and sweet introduction? Have you designed your website with personality? <a href="https://letasobierajski.com/" target="_blank">Example</a>.</li>
        <li>Are you showing interesting project images so the user is likely to click on them? <a href="https://gvo.works/" target="_blank">Example</a>.</li>
        <li>Are there other engaging elements like animations, hover effects?</li>
        <li>This project can be as complicated or simple as you'd like. Grade is based on your creativity, how you've incorporated your personality into your design, and how you use code to create an inviting user experience. If you have other ideas of what you'd like this personal website to be, lmk.</li>
        <li>Optional: use media queries to make the website responsive.</li>
        <li>Optional: Use Javascript or JQuery to make the website more interactive.</li>
        <li>Upload and replace the index file from your main URL <i>github-username.github.io</i> or use a new folder. Also upload additional files and sub-folders. Add the URL to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jIyYjKi0HmZT9r9SZ3Yr2WoFCXArSkFv3XQtAZ4hZbs/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">spreadsheet</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      -->
      <p>Project will not be presented. You are only required to add the URL to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16c9pSDthgbfFv7zPUyde-edU-30LOT2TNnuy8vnBUOw/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">spreadsheet</a>.</p>
