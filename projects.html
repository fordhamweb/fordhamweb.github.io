      <h3>Project 1: One-Page Website due Oct 6</h3>
      <p>Make a one-page website about your favorite person, place or thing. Use this opportunity to use your beginner knowledge of HTML and CSS. You can include text, images, animated gifs, reviews, characters, your personal thoughts, original images you create, etc. What is the purpose of your website (to communicate, to convince, to sell, to experiment, to write)? Be flexible with the presentation and design - you will likely NOT be able to do what you envision but work within those limitations. As in all projects, experiment! </p>
      <p>Requirements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>One page only (index.html), a stylesheet and a folder for images and other assets.</li>
        <li>Use as many HTML tags and CSS properties as you'd like.</li>
        <li>Websites do not have to be responsive, you can adjust the browser to the size you need for the presentation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Recommended Process:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Think about what kind of content you'd like to include and start gathering it. For example if doing a person, a full biography will be very long so perhaps focus on one aspect. If using text from another website, please source and provide a link. </li>
        <li>Create a local folder "project1". Folder should contain index.html, a stylesheet and a sub-folder for images and other assets.</li>
        <li>When the project is complete, upload this entire folder to your GitHub class website. The link should look something like: <i>github-username.github.io/class-site/project1/</i>. You can continue to edit your project and re-upload.</li>
        <li>Add your URL to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UWjp6Sp7CsD-A58DPQxY7hFijW3FLDKn0KdJoCm4nZM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">spreadsheet</a>.</li>
      </ol>

      <div id="pr2" class="anchor"></div>

      <h3>Project 2: Narrative</h3>
            <p>Create a website that tells a story. You could use an existing short story, fairy tale, poem. Or, you can design a personal narrative: 24 hours in my day, my favorite artists, how to make my mom's chocolate cake, why I love <i>Friends</i> tv show, etc. Consider the UI and UX aspects of the website.</p>
      <p>Requirements:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Multiple pages or a single page.</li>
      <li>Use text, images, or videos. </li>
      <li>Think about the various ways users can access parts of the story - do they need to follow a set path (linear) or can they view the story in a random order (non-linear)? How will you lead them there? Also consider how your design will help the user figure out what to click on.</li>
      <li>Your website could be informative, artistic, or experimental. What’s important is that it demonstrates how the web can be used to communicate in a linear or non-linear way.</li>
      <li>Bonus if your website is responsive!</li>
    </ul>
      <p>Recommended Process:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Choose an existing story or write/compose the story. It could be written from beginning to end or you could write it as a series of ideas with no beginning or end.</li>
      <li>Create a site map to figure out how the pages are connected.</li>
      <li>Sketch out page layout ideas. Gather or create assets such as images or videos.</li>
      <!--<li><a href="files/10-WebSlides.pdf" target="_blank">Refer to the slideshow</a> for inspo.</li>-->
      <li>Design with html/css in a local folder "project2". Folder should contain html pages, a stylesheet and a sub-folder for images and other assets.</li>
        <li>When the project is complete, upload this entire folder to your GitHub class website. The link should look something like: <i>username.github.io/class-site/project2/</i>. You can continue to edit your project and re-upload.</li>
        <li>Add your URL to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UWjp6Sp7CsD-A58DPQxY7hFijW3FLDKn0KdJoCm4nZM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">spreadsheet</a>.</li>
      <li>Project 2 will be presented in class. If your project is late, you will not be able to present it which will affect your grade.</li>
    </ol>
