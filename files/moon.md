If the moon smiled, she would resemble you. You leave the same impression Of something beautiful, but annihilating.
~Sylvia Plath

Moon Trash
Since the moon landing in 1969, astronauts have left over 400,000 pounds of material on the moon including aircraft, cameras, magazines, bags of urine (!), photographs, sculptures, space food, American flags, and golf balls.

Moons Names
Thanks to indigenous people, the full moon in January is called a wolf moon after the howling of hungry wolves. Other full moon names include the harvest moon in September, the strawberry moon in June, and the cold moon in December.

Moon Living
It's really difficult for humans to survive on the moon in any permanent fashion given the moon's extremely thin atmosphere, lack of liquid water, dust problem, and enormous temperature range.

The Moon and I
by Annette Wynne
We played a game—the moon and I,
The moon was laughing in the sky,
I spied her, too, and called aloud,
But still she hid behind a cloud.
