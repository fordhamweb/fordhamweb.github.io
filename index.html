      <h3>Course Overview </h3>
      <p>This course is an introduction to website design from a visual and technical perspective. It focuses on the basic languages of front-end web development: HTML, CSS, and Javascript in conjunction with the principles of graphic design, typography, and user experience. Coursework emphasizes programming as an artistic medium, a way of making and exploring. Students are encouraged to create handcrafted, creative websites that are personalized, conceptual, experimental, and communicative (not automated or built from templates). Through project-based assignments and readings, students will examine the space of the web at large and explore and challenge what a website is.  Projects may be messy and imperfect but that’s ok!  No prior programming experience is required. </p>

<p>Writing code almost always involves the appropriation and adaptation of other people’s work. In this class we are participating in communities of shared practices. However, any work you borrow and/or modify must be labeled as such. If you find sample code and integrate it into your work, this must be clearly and obviously indicated as such by using inline comments in your code - this includes generative AI tools (such as ChatGPT). Failure to do so will be considered the same as any other breach of academic integrity. Do not plagiarize code as a quick solution - your projects can incorporate the ideas of others but should reflect your original, creative approach.
