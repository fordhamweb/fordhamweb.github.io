      <p>This course is an introduction to web design from a visual and technical perspective, emphasizing coding as an artistic medium—a way of making handcrafted, creative websites. Through project-based assignments and readings, students will explore and challenge what a website is, and experiment with various tools and techniques to produce an interactive design portfolio of visual projects. Coursework focuses on the basic languages of front-end web development: HTML, CSS, and Javascript in conjunction with the principles of graphic design, typography, and user experience. Projects will be messy and imperfect but that’s ok! No prior coding experience is required. LET'S GO!</p>

<p>Note: Writing code almost always involves the appropriation and adaptation of other people’s work. In this class we are participating in communities of shared practices. However, any work you borrow and/or modify must be labeled as such. If you find sample code and integrate it into your work, this must be clearly and obviously indicated as such by using inline comments in your code - this includes generative AI tools (such as ChatGPT). Failure to do so will be considered the same as any other breach of academic integrity. Do not plagiarize code as a quick solution - your projects can incorporate the ideas of others but should reflect your original, creative approach.
