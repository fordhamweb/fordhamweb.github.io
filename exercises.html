      <h3>Website Picks: Ongoing</h3>
      <p>Take note of websites you find interesting, weird, fun, well-designed, charming, colorful, scary, stupid, etc. Keep a list somewhere. Time permitting each class, you'll show us these website picks.</p>

      <h3>Exercise 1: GitHub Setup and Introduction Page</h3>
      <p>We'll be using the GitHub developer platform to host your personal class website - to be used to store and present all exercises and projects. GitHub websites are stored in a "repositories" which you can think of as a folder on your computer.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Create an account on <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> (make sure to verify the account) using your Fordham email.</li>
        <li>After you're logged in, go to your main repositories page. Click the NEW button.</li>
        <li>Name your repository whatever you would like (something like “class-site” if you can’t think of anything).</li>
        <li>Select PUBLIC (Anyone on the internet can see this repository).</li>
        <li>Check Add a README file.</li>
        <li>Leave other options as-is.</li>
        <li>Click CREATE REPOSITORY.</li>
        <li>You are now viewing the contents of the repository which are currently empty except for the README file. A README file is simply a description of the contents of the respository. Click the edit icon if you'd like to change the text of the README file.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>In order for your repository to be treated and rendered like a website, you need to initialize GitHub Pages on this repository. Github pages is a feature that makes it easy and free to host handmade websites.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Click SETTINGS in the top navigation.</li>
        <li>Click PAGES in the left navigation.</li>
        <li>Under BRANCH, select MAIN. Click the SAVE button.</li>
        <li>Wait a few minutes and refresh the page. You will see your repo link: <i>username.github.io/class-site</i></li>
      </ol>
      <p>As you complete exercises and projects, you will add these files to the repo. In this exercise, we will create an introduction homepage (index.html) but going forward, the process is:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Click the ADD FILE > UPLOAD FILES button at the top of the repository.</li>
        <li>Drag the new files or folders to the area indicated. </li>
        <li>COMMIT CHANGES - this is where you add some short description of what you've changed to keep track of your activity (something like "first upload", "updated homepage", "add new project", etc.)</li>
        <li>Wait a few minutes and then check your repo link.</li>
        <li>Add your URL to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oC0ZSJQ6mBaekrM_ds9U9-OCgyaDhHAp-Nv8KPY3E3Q/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">spreadsheet</a>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Note: GitHub has many features, including a desktop app that automatically updates your repo. We will not be using the app but feel free to try out these features on your own computer.</p>

<h3>Exercise 2: Text and Images</h3>
<p><a href="files/dieter.md" target="_blank">Use this text</a> to recreate <i>Ten Principles for Good Design by Dieter Rams</i>. How can you communicate using text and images? Use what you know about HTML and CSS (also, refer to the <a href="resources.html" target="_blank">resources</a>) and follow these instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li>One page only, a stylesheet and a folder for images</li>
  <li>Include one image for each of the 10 principles which demonstrates the principle in your opinion (be creative, do not use Dieter Ram images, you can also create your own images). These can be placed anywhere that makes sense within your design. Resize your images using the width or height attributes in HTML or use CSS; make sure they are not distorted.</li>
  <li>Use as many HTML tags and CSS properties as you'd like.</li>
   <li>In terms of design, think about what the choice of fonts, colors and placement of images says about what you're communicating.</li>
  <li>Remember this is an exercise - do your best, even if its not perfect!</li>
</ul>
 <p>Recommended Process:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a local folder "exercise2". Folder should contain index.html, a stylesheet and a sub-folder for images.</li>
<li>Upload this folder to your GitHub class website. The URL should look something like: <i>username.github.io/class-site/exercise2/</i>. Add the URL to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oC0ZSJQ6mBaekrM_ds9U9-OCgyaDhHAp-Nv8KPY3E3Q/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">spreadsheet</a>.</li>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Exercise 3: Interactive</h3>

<p>Pick a song lyric of any length and design a one-page website that uses <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_hover.php" target="_blank">hover effects</a>, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_transitions.asp" target="_blank">transitions</a>, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_transform.php" target="_blank">transform</a>, and/or <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp" target="_blank">animation</a>. You can choose to do this purely typographically or add other graphics as necessary. Think about what elements are interactive vs. animated. What visual cues can you include in the design to let the user know to hover or click on something? Be expressive and experiment!</p>
      <p>Examples: <a href="https://sshafiq1.github.io/Web-Design/exercise3/index.html" target="_blank">Flower</a>, <a href="https://reedgulden.github.io/Excercise-3/" target="_blank">Felt</a>, <a href="https://isabelle-massaro.github.io/web-design/bee/" target="_blank">Bee</a>, <a href="https://clyscc.github.io/Web-Design-Fordham/web-design-excercise3/" target="_blank">Sunburn</a></p>

<p>Upload a folder to your GitHub class website. The URL should look something like: <i>username.github.io/class-site/exercise3/</i>. Add the URL to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oC0ZSJQ6mBaekrM_ds9U9-OCgyaDhHAp-Nv8KPY3E3Q/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">spreadsheet</a>.</p>


<div id="ex4" class="anchor"></div>

<h3>Exercise 4: Organism</h3>
<p>Create an organism using code. It is up to you to define what the word "organism" means. Is it a monster, an animal, a human, a thing that looks like a collage, a collection of shapes, abstract, etc.? Does it move, animate, respond to the cursor? Does it contain images or text? </p>  

<p>Examples: <a href="https://fordhamweb.github.io/blob/" target="_blank">Blob</a>, <a href="https://fordhamweb.github.io/sun/" target="_blank">Sun</a></p>
<p>Upload a folder to your GitHub class website. The URL should look something like: <i>username.github.io/class-site/exercise4/</i>. Add the URL to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oC0ZSJQ6mBaekrM_ds9U9-OCgyaDhHAp-Nv8KPY3E3Q/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">spreadsheet</a>.</p>



<div id="ex5" class="anchor"></div>

<h3>Exercise 5: Responsive</h3>
      
      <p>Create an experimental, responsive, one-page website that changes across different screen sizes using media queries. </p>
      <ul>
      <li>from day to night</li>
      <li>breakfast then lunch then dinner</li>
      <li>rain then sun then snow</li>
      <li>small to medium to large</li>
    </ul>
      <p>do colors change? does type change size? do things appear or disappear? is there animation? how might your design communicate different feelings or meanings when it adapts?</p>
      <p>Examples: <a href="https://jacobhoving.com/collection.html" target="_blank">Jacob Hoving</a>, <a href="https://cowthat.github.io/class-site/projects/accordian/index.html" target="_blank">Cow That</a>, <a href="https://ft-tanvishah.github.io/WebsiteDesign_Spring-25/ex4/index.html" target="_blank">In a Week</a>, <a href="https://cmagtibay.github.io/webdesign/exercise4/" target="_blank">Caterpillar</a>, <a href="https://miamagdaraog.github.io/webdesign/exercise4/" target="_blank">Tea Party</a></p>
      <p>Upload a folder to your GitHub class website. The URL should look something like: <i>username.github.io/class-site/exercise5/</i>. Add the URL to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oC0ZSJQ6mBaekrM_ds9U9-OCgyaDhHAp-Nv8KPY3E3Q/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">spreadsheet</a>.</p>
