        <h2>A cupcake, fairy cake, or bun is a small cake designed to serve one person, which may be baked in a small thin paper or aluminum cup. </h2>

        <p>A standard cupcake uses the same basic ingredients as standard-sized cakes: butter, sugar, eggs, and flour. Nearly any recipe that is suitable for a layer cake can be used to bake cupcakes. The cake batter used for cupcakes may be flavored or have other ingredients stirred in, such as raisins, berries, nuts, or chocolate chips.</p>
        <p>Because their small size is more efficient for heat conduction, cupcakes bake much faster than a normal layered cake. Cupcakes may be topped with frosting or other cake decorations. Elaborately decorated cupcakes may be made for special occasions.</p>
