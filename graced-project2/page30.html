            <p><span>The old woman worked long days at her market stall, gone from morning to night — yet each evening she returned to a tidy home and a warm meal.</span>
<br>
<span>One day she pretended to leave and saw you step out of the fragrant fruit.<br>
Overjoyed, she broke it open and adopted you.</span>
<br>
<span>Later, the King passed through the distant market.<br>
At her stall, he tasted a piece of betel arranged in the style he recognized as yours.</span>
<br>
<span>Shaken, he asked who prepared it.<br>
When you stepped forward, he knew instantly — and the two of you joyfully returned to the palace together.</span></p>
