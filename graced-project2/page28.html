            <p><span>Unfortunately for Cám, you are far from gone.<br>
Your spirit clings to the loom carved from the fallen tree, and whenever Cam uses it, your voice rises from the wood — sharp, furious, unmistakable.
<br>
You threaten her for taking your husband.</span>
<br>
<span>Cám's face drains of color.<br>
She can no longer stay in the same room as the loom, let alone weave on it.</span>
<br>
<span>Terrified, she drags the loom far from the palace grounds.<br>
There, trembling, she sets it on fire.<br>
When only ashes remain, she scatters them to the wind and hurries back to the palace, convinced that this time, she has finally destroyed you.</span>
<br>
<span>She is wrong — again.</span></p>
