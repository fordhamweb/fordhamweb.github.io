            <p><span>The steam rises, and Cam’s screams fade quickly.<br>
Cám is gone, but your vengeance is not.</span>
<br>
<span>You have her body prepared like mắm — fermented fish sauce — and sealed in a jar.<br>
Then you send it to your stepmother, labeling the gift under Cam’s name.<br>
<br>
Your stepmother, unaware of the “ingredient,” eats from the jar day after day.<br>
She praises the flavor, believing her beloved daughter sent it from the palace.</span>
<br>
<span>One afternoon, as she sits down to eat, a crow swoops in and cries out the truth:<br>
“You’re eating your own child!”<br>
She waves the bird away, refusing to believe it.<br>
<br>
But when she finally reaches the bottom of the jar, she finds Cam’s skull staring up at her.<br>
The shock is so great that she collapses and dies instantly.</span>
<br>
<span>And you live happily ever after.</span></p>
